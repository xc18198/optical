This report explores the concept of semantic communication and its potential to enhance communication efficiency in optical fibre transmission. Unlike traditional communication systems that prioritise accurate symbol transmission, semantic communication focusses on conveying the intended meaning of a message. By processing data in the semantic domain, this approach enables filtering irrelevant details and compressing data while preserving its essence. The report proposes a system design incorporating a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for semantic coding within an optical channel. This innovative approach demonstrates substantial improvements in communication efficiency compared to conventional methods. The training process involves a collaborative effort between the transmitter and receiver, utilising a library dataset of empirical data and corresponding pragmatic tasks. The report concludes by highlighting promising avenues for future research in semantic communication, including the use of emerging machine learning techniques, the development of comprehensive theoretical frameworks, and the creation of extensive datasets specifically tailored to semantic communication applications.
